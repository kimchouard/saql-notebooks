    "# Using Funnel Charts\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple funnel is not very different from a single bar stacked-bar chart where the size of a slice indicates the volume of that stage and its relation to the other stages in that stack. \n",
    "To create a simple Wave funnel chart in Explorer, select a measure like sum of amount and group by Stage. Clip this lens to your dashboard and change chart type to funnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a stacked bar, the order of stages is important in a funnel chart though. An easy way to set order is to name stages with a preceding number to indicate its order in the list. For example: \"0-Lead\", \"4-Closed Won\", etc. The stage renaming can be done either through the dataflow or via SAQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage Renaming\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the Dataflow\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible to rename the Stage using computeExpression action in the dataflow. If desired, labels can be changed from \"0-Lead\" to \"Lead\" in the user XMD.  More information on XMD key labels can be found in the Extended Metadata (XMD) Reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In SAQL\n",
    "\n",
    "The stage renaming can also be done on the fly in SAQL, here is an example:"
