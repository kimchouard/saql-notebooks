    "There are various reasons that your data could be out of date. For example, your bookings from an external data source may only get updated once a month on the 5th. On March 1 - 4, you still want to report off of January data. In these cases, standard relative dates may not be appropriate. Filtering for “previous month” on February 28th will give us our previous month’s bookings data; however, on March 1st, the “previous month” filter will look for data for February’s bookings data, which does not get entered into the system until four more days. The work around for this is to use the following steps:"

If we were to try using standard relative dates like in the query below, the result would be $0 because there is no data for the current month."

    "The order of execution will be to order the dataset by Year and Month ascending and the `sum('Amount')` which will give the Sum for the current month and `sum(sum('Amount'))` which will give us the sum for the previous month because `over([1 .. 1])` indicates that we go one month previous and subtracting -1 at the end to get MoM. Since the partitioning is by “all”, windowing will happen across all Year-Month. At the end since we are limiting the result set\n",
    "by 1, we will only get the Most recent available Month in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even though the windowing function contains the keywords “order by”, the resulting stream is not guaranteed to be ordered (the “order by” here is for the calculation). This is why there is a separate “order by” statement following the windowing function.\n",

    "## Timeline Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of time-based analysis is comparing how we are trending in the current quarter versus the same time last year. This type of analysis is useful for seeing if we are on-track, lagging, or ahead by using a previous time period as a benchmark."
