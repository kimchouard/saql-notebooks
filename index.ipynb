    "Salesforce Analytics Cloud is a cloud-based platform for connecting data from multiple sources, creating interactive views of that data, and sharing those views in dashboards. It's a better way to distribute insight to business users so they can understand and take action on changing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Salesforce Overview](/images/home/SFDCArchitecture.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "￼The basic unit of consumption of data in Wave Analytics Cloud is a Lens. A lens could be a single query step with its visualization widgets or a compilation of steps with corresponding widgets. The later is often referred to as a dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dig deeper into SAQL, let’s understand the different terminologies we use in Wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset contains a set of source data, specially formatted and optimized for interactive exploration. Data is stored as denormalized records in key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Salesforce Overview](/images/home/Dataset1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave dataset has a schema-free design, enabling them to scale with new dimensions or measures without disrupting existing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Salesforce Overview](/images/home/Dataset2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is pushed into Wave through an ELT (Extract, Load, and Transform) process from Salesforce objects or external data loaded as CSV files or using a partner ETL tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of transformations can be applied to data during the ELT process. Details about all the available transform operations are available [here](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=bi_integrate_tranformation_overview.htm&language=en_US).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wave Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave runtime (browser and mobile app) evaluates the steps, widgets, and layouts to render the final dashboard. It auto-facets the compact steps and resolves bindings and templates. Every step is converted to a SAQL query that gets to the engine for execution. The resulting data is passed to the charting library that renders it using corresponding widget definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Salesforce Overview](/images/home/WaveRuntime.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "More information about dashboard elements is available [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.bi_dev_guide_json.meta/bi_dev_guide_json/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of a Wave Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave dashboards are created using the Builder and stored 2 as JSON documents in the Salesforce core system objects. Every dashboard contains a state node and other identifying metadata.\n",
